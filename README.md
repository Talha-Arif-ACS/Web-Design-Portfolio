# 💻 Web Design Essentials Portfolio - Talha Arif

This repository marks the culmination of the HTML and CSS projects that I worked on throughout this semester in my Web
Design Essentials Course. The objective was to build a robust, well-structured foundation to which advanced design
principles were progressively applied. Each phase of this project demonstrates mastery of specific learning modules,
eventually converging into a unified, high-performance homepage. [🚀 View Live Portfolio](YOUR_GITHUB_PAGES_URL_HERE)

## Project Objective

The goal of this assignment series was to build a well-structured page as a skeleton for future design application. Each
subsequent assignment served as a milestone to demonstrate mastery of specific learning content. Once all subpages were
completed, they were integrated into a final, polished homepage as the finishing touch.
