                    The portfolio you are looking for is currently under construction. I am aware that you are very
                    excited to see my progress but you will have to be patient until January.
                </p>
                <p>In the mean time, I am working very hard to keep this portfolio away from prying eyes!</p>
                <hr />
                <p>I hope to show you some very nice pages soon!</p>
